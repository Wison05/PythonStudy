# Python Weekly Practice

I’m studying Python and will keep building small practice projects each week to improve my programming skills.

## Weeks

* **Week 01:** Practiced Python fundamentals with conditions/loops, lists/dictionaries, a word-frequency text analyzer (with banned-word masking), and exception handling with file I/O.
